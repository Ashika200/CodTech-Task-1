## Overview
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Iris dataset to uncover insights, patterns, and trends. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community and contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

The main objectives of this project are:
- To understand the distribution and relationships between features in the dataset.
- To identify patterns that differentiate the three species of iris.
- To visualize the data for intuitive understanding and better decision-making.
- To generate actionable insights that can guide further model development or classification tasks.

## Project Details

### Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples with 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Each sample is labeled with one of the three iris species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica. The analysis aims to explore the characteristics of these species and identify distinct patterns.

### Key Tasks
1. Data Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset is ready for analysis.
2. Data Visualization: Using graphs and plots to explore relationships between features.
3. Statistical Analysis: Examining summary statistics and distributions.
4. Reporting: Summarizing findings and identifying key differentiators between species.

### Tools and Libraries
This project utilizes the following tools and libraries:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

### How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository using the command:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd [project-directory]
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `EDA_analysis.ipynb` to view and execute the code.

### Results
The analysis provides insights into:
- The distribution of features across the three iris species.
